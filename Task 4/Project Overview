The Rock, Paper, Scissors game is a classic hand game that is played between two people, where each player simultaneously forms one of three shapes with their hand. 
The possible shapes are "rock," "paper," and "scissors." The game is simple and quick, providing an opportunity for a fun and engaging experience. 
This project implements a digital version of the game where the user plays against a computer opponent.

Objectives:
    Create an interactive game that allows a user to play Rock, Paper, Scissors against the computer.
    Implement game logic to determine the winner based on the standard rules: rock beats scissors, scissors beat paper, and paper beats rock.
    Provide a user-friendly interface that offers clear instructions and feedback.
    Incorporate score tracking to keep track of wins, losses, and ties for both the user and the computer.
    Enable replay functionality to allow the user to play multiple rounds.

Features:
    User Input: Prompts the user to select one of the three options: rock, paper, or scissors.
    Computer Selection: The computer randomly selects one of the three options.
    Game Logic: Determines the winner based on the choices made by the user and the computer.
    Result Display: Shows the choices made by both the user and the computer, and indicates the result of the game (win, lose, or tie).
    Score Tracking: Keeps track of the number of wins, losses, and ties for both the user and the computer across multiple rounds.
    Play Again: Asks the user if they want to play another round and restarts the game if the user agrees.
    User Interface: Provides a simple and intuitive text-based interface with clear instructions and feedback.

Technical Requirements:
    Programming Language: Python
    Libraries: random for generating computer choices
    Environment: Command-line interface (CLI) or terminal for interaction

Implementation Details:
    Use Python’s random.choice() to generate the computer’s choice.
    Implement a loop to handle multiple rounds of the game.
    Use conditional statements to determine the outcome of each round.
    Display the results and update scores after each round.
    Provide options for the user to play again or exit the game.

Future Enhancements:
    Develop a graphical user interface (GUI) for a more visually appealing experience.
    Add additional features such as player profiles, high scores, and game statistics.
    Implement an AI opponent with different levels of difficulty.

Usage:
To play the game, run the Python script in a terminal or command prompt. Follow the on-screen prompts to make your choice and enjoy the game!
This project provides a great opportunity to practice basic programming concepts and user interaction design in a fun and engaging way.
