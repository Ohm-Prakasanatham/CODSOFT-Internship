The Simple Calculator is a command-line application designed to perform basic arithmetic operations. 
It allows users to input two numbers and select an arithmetic operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division) to perform on these numbers. 
The calculator handles basic error checking, including validation of input types and division by zero.

Features
    Basic Arithmetic Operations:
        Addition
        Subtraction
        Multiplication
        Division

    User Interaction:
        Users are prompted to enter two numbers.
        Users can select an operation to perform from a menu.
        The result of the operation is displayed.
        After each calculation, users are asked if they want to perform another calculation.

    Error Handling:
        Validates that the inputs are numbers.
        Checks for division by zero and handles it gracefully by displaying an error message.

How It Works
    Welcome and Menu Display:
        The application starts by displaying a welcome message and a menu of operations.
        Users are prompted to select an operation by entering the corresponding number.

    Input Handling:
        The application prompts the user to enter two numbers.
        It validates the input to ensure the numbers are valid floats.

    Performing Calculations:
        Based on the user's choice, the corresponding arithmetic operation is performed.
        The result is displayed to the user.

    Repeating Calculations:
        After displaying the result, the user is asked if they want to perform another calculation.
        If the user enters 'yes', the process repeats. Otherwise, the application terminates.
